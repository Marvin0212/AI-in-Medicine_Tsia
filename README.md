## Pathological ECG Signal Classification - PhysioNet Challenge

**Project Description:**

This repository contains my work for the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge, where the goal was to develop effective algorithms for the classification of pathological ECG signals. The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to preprocessing, feature extraction, model development, and evaluation of ECG data, leveraging the power of deep learning to achieve accurate classification results.

### Key Components:

1. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: The project includes detailed preprocessing steps for ECG signal data, such as noise filtering, data augmentation, and standardization. Feature extraction techniques, particularly Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), are employed to transform the time-series data into a more informative representation for classification tasks.

2. **Model Development**: Multiple neural network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for time-series and frequency-domain data, have been developed and optimized. The models are designed to effectively capture the complex patterns in ECG signals that are indicative of various cardiac conditions.

3. **Model Optimization and Selection**: The repository includes `predict_pretrained.py`, a file showcasing the training and architecture optimization process. Hyperparameter tuning and experimentation with different model structures are detailed to demonstrate the methodology behind selecting the best-performing models.

4. **Stack Model for Improved Accuracy**: A unique approach was taken by creating a stack model that combines predictions from several trained models. This technique enhances the overall predictive performance by leveraging the strengths of individual models.

5. **Models Directory**: All trained models are saved in the 'Models' directory. These models represent a diverse set of neural network architectures, each fine-tuned for the task of ECG signal classification.

6. **Inference on New Data**: The `predict.py` file is provided for inference, utilizing the trained models to classify new ECG data. This script demonstrates the application of the models in a practical, real-world scenario, showcasing their robustness and accuracy.
